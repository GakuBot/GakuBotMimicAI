# GakuBot


## What is GakuBot?

* GakuBot is an experimental machine learning game.
* This game simulates two players both trying to get to the same target.The winner is the first player to reach the target.
* This game has several different versions, which are really just different ways of training the AI to learn how to play the game.
* The aim of the game is for both yourself and the AI to learn how to play, and to observe how the AI learns the game.
* This is the app version of this game, but the slightly more rudimentary browser version is available at [GakuBot.com](https://gakubot.com)

## How do I play?

* Your character is a yellow circle.
* Your aim is to get "home" (the brown circle in the middle of the screen) before your opponent, the pink circle, does.
* You move it by clicking to where you would like it to go to, and it will start moving in that direction.
* The only other mechanic of the game is that you can "tag" your opponent by touching them. Once you tag them, the one of you who is closest to home is frozen still for a few seconds. Therefore, be wary of pulling out ahead of your opponent in case they tag you and romp on home to victory.
* Flash mode and hulk mode have been added to this game to create more challenging opponents to play against once you have mastered classic mode.

## How does it work?

* This game uses the [Synaptic](http://caza.la/synaptic/) library for supervised learning of a liquid state network.
